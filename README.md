# Machine-Learning-using-Python
Predict no. of medals in Olympics

Goal

The goal of this project is to make a prediction model which will predict whether an athlete will win medal or not.


DATASET

The dataset which is used in this project, is collected from Kaggle.


LIBRARIES NEEDED

Pandas
Numpy
Sklearn
Matplotlib


Project Implementation

Importing all the required libraries. Check requirements.txt
Upload the dataset and the Jupyter Notebook file.
Loading and Cleaning the dataset.
Encoding textual columns.
Select best 10 features and make a new dataframe using them
Split dataframe into train and test data along with scaling.
Apply different classification models and calculate their accuracy.
Choose best model for our prediction which has highest accuracy.
Make the final prediction using best model.


Conclusion

Random Forest Classifier Model gives highest accuracy.
